# Emotion Detection

## Scenario
You have been hired as a software engineer by an e-commerce company to create an AI-based web app that performs analytics on customer feedback for their signature products. To accomplish this requirement, you will create an Emotion Detection system that processes feedback provided by the customer in text format and deciphers the associated emotion expressed.

## Introduction
In this final project, you will be assessed on the knowledge gained on all aspects of app creation and its web deployment throughout this course. You will be required to save screenshots of your results from time to time, with specific nomenclature. These screenshots will have to be uploaded in the peer graded assignment that follows.

In this project, we use the embeddable **Watson AI libraries** to **create an emotion detection application**.

Emotion detection extends the concept of sentiment analysis by extracting the finer emotions, like joy, sadness, anger, and so on, from statements rather than the simple polarity that sentiment analysis provides. This makes emotion detection a very important branch of study and businesses use such systems widely for their AI based recommendation systems, automated chat bots, and so on.

## Project guidelines
### Tasks and objectives:

- #### Task 1: Clone the project repository
    
    Start by cloning the project repository to your local environment. This will provide you with the necessary code and resources to begin your work.

    This is the original project link: [https://github.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/oaqjp-final-project-emb-ai.git](https://github.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/oaqjp-final-project-emb-ai.git) but I have cloned it on my local machine and pushed it again on new repo for a purpose of using it in the VS Code IDE, linked with the following link: [https://github.com/nayan07cse/Emotion-Detector/tree/main](https://github.com/nayan07cse/Emotion-Detector/tree/main) and uploaded into my own repo.

- #### Task 2: Create an emotion detection application using Watson NLP library
    Utilize the Watson NLP library to develop an emotion detection application. This application will analyze text input and identify the underlying emotions.

- #### Task 3: Format the output of the application
    Ensure that the output of your emotion detection application is well-formatted and user-friendly. Users should be able to understand the emotions identified.

- #### Task 4: Package the application
    Package your application for ease of deployment. You should have a clear and concise set of instructions for deploying it.

- #### Task 5: Run Unit tests on your application
    Test your application thoroughly to ensure it functions as expected. Create unit tests to validate its behavior.

- #### Task 6: Deploy as web application using Flask
    Take your emotion detection application and deploy it as a web application using the Flask framework. This step involves making your application accessible over the web.

- #### Task 7: Incorporate Error handling
    Implement robust error handling to ensure that your application gracefully handles unexpected situations.

- #### Task 8: Run static code analysis
    Perform static code analysis to review your code for potential issues, code quality, and adherence to best practices.

    By completing these tasks, you will have created a functional emotion detection web application that can be accessed by users on the internet.

    Good luck with your project, and don't forget to save screenshots of your results as you progress. These will be required for your peer-graded assignment submission.
